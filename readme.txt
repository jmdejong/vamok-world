-- Vision --

I want to make this a sandbox-ish rpg.

The closest game to my idea is "Don't starve".
The main differences with don't starve are:
 - text-based graphics
 - this is a bit more multiplayer oriented (though to be honest, I've never player don't starve together)
 - no permadeath
 - the startgame is somewhat less deadly (danger is mainly there when you search for it), but progression is slower
 - not all actions require full-time user interaction
